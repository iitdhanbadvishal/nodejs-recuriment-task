## Prerequisites

Need to have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your computer to run the service

## Run locally for moviws-server

1. Clone this repository
1. Run from root dir

```
JWT_SECRET=secret MONGO_URI=`mongo db uri` API_KEY=`API key of https://omdbapi.com/` docker-compose up -d
```

By default the movies service will start on port `3001` but you can override
the default value by setting the `APP_PORT` env var

```
APP_PORT=3005 JWT_SECRET=secret MONGO_URI=`mongo db uri` API_KEY=`API key of https://omdbapi.com/` docker-compose up -d
```

To stop the authorization service run

```
docker-compose down
```

## Technology
